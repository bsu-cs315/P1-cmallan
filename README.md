## Project Report Iteration 1

### Reflection
During this iteration I was mainly just struggling with errors in my code keeping my game from running, one for which I was stuck on for the entirety of the last two iterations. When I did finally figure out the problem, I found this iteration and specifically working with the AnimationPlayer quite delicate, I was struggling to incorporate the AnimationPlayer and have it take affect but when I finally did figure it out it was much easier than I expected.
