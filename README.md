## Project Report Iteration 1

### Reflection
What I found challenging for this iteration was getting comfortable with using the Collision detection of the Physics system in Godot.
This iteration did solidify my ability to use GitBash and help me feel much more comfortable writing the commands knowing what each command is responsible for.
